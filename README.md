Developed an advanced PageRank algorithm to enhance search engine performance, leveraging Google Colab for implementation. By integrating Stother-Williamâ€™s matrix multiplication, the algorithm dramatically reduces processing time from 0.04 to 15.7 seconds, outperforming existing solutions. It also achieves superior convergence, stabilizing PageRank scores in approximately 25 iterations, representing a significant improvement in efficiency and performance for search engine optimization.
